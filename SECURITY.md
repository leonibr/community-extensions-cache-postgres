   - Release the fix following our standard release process

4. **Public Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the timing of public disclosure.

## Security Best Practices

When using Community.Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.PostgreSql in your applications, consider these security recommendations:

1. **Database Access**

   - Use a dedicated PostgreSQL user with minimal privileges
   - Restrict the user's access to only the cache schema and tables
   - Use connection string encryption in production

2. **Connection String Security**

   ```csharp
   // Do not store connection strings in code
   services.AddPostgreSqlCache(options =>
   {
       options.ConnectionString = Configuration.GetConnectionString("PostgreSqlCache");
       // ...
   });
   ```

3. **Schema Isolation**

   - Use a separate schema for cache tables
   - Implement proper access controls at the database level

4. **Data Protection**
   - Consider encrypting sensitive cached data before storage
   - Implement proper key rotation policies
   - Use HTTPS for all communications in distributed scenarios

## Security Updates

- Security updates are released as soon as possible after validation
- Updates follow semantic versioning
- Breaking changes in security updates are avoided when possible
- Security advisories will be published on our GitHub repository

## Audit Logging

The package includes basic audit logging through ILogger. To enhance security monitoring:

1. Configure appropriate log levels
1. Enable structured logging
1. Monitor cache operations through logs
1. Implement alerts for suspicious patterns, such as failed login attempts or suspicious activity.

## Known Security Best Practices for PostgreSQL Cache

1. **Connection Pooling**

   ```csharp
   services.AddPostgreSqlCache(options =>
   {
       options.DataSourceFactory = () =>
       {
           var dataSourceBuilder = new NpgsqlDataSourceBuilder(connectionString);
           dataSourceBuilder.EnablePooling();
           dataSourceBuilder.MaxPoolSize = 50; // Adjust based on your application's requirements
           return dataSourceBuilder.Build();
       };
   });
   ```

2. **Timeout Settings**
   ```csharp
   services.AddPostgreSqlCache(options =>
   {
       options.CommandTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30); // Adjust based on your application's requirements
       // ...
   });
   ```
